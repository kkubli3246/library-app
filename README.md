# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start the project
In this proect the middlware and frontend are set to run on seperate ports.

### Middleware - npm start
The middleware is started seperatly. This middleware is where the Database information is stored to create a connection to the front-end side of the application. The default connection variables can be set in the env file.

### Front end UI - npm start
The React front end is used to start off the web server to run on a seperate port then the middleware. Within this project the connection to the middle ware is set with the datasource.js
